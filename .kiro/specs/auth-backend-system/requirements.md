# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive authentication backend system built in Go that supports multiple protocols (REST/gRPC), flexible token management (JWT/Paseto), configurable password hashing (Argon2/bcrypt), and enterprise-grade features. The system is designed to be flexible enough for use in various applications from social media to banking, similar to FusionAuth or Firebase Authentication.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Protocol API Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate authentication services through both REST and gRPC protocols, so that I can choose the most appropriate communication method for my application architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client makes a REST API call to /api/v1/auth/login THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and return appropriate response
2. WHEN a client makes a gRPC call to AuthService.Login THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and return appropriate response
3. WHEN the system receives requests on both protocols simultaneously THEN it SHALL handle them concurrently without conflicts
4. IF a REST endpoint exists THEN there SHALL be an equivalent gRPC method with the same functionality

### Requirement 2: Flexible Token Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure token management to use either JWT or Paseto tokens, so that I can choose the security approach that best fits my requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is configured for JWT tokens THEN it SHALL generate, validate, and refresh JWT tokens according to RFC 7519
2. WHEN the system is configured for Paseto tokens THEN it SHALL generate, validate, and refresh Paseto tokens according to Paseto specification
3. WHEN a token expires THEN the system SHALL provide a refresh mechanism that maintains security
4. IF token configuration changes THEN existing valid tokens SHALL remain functional until expiration

### Requirement 3: Configurable Password Security

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want to choose between Argon2 and bcrypt for password hashing, so that I can optimize for either security strength or performance based on my requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is configured for Argon2 THEN it SHALL hash passwords using Argon2id with configurable parameters
2. WHEN the system is configured for bcrypt THEN it SHALL hash passwords using bcrypt with configurable cost factor
3. WHEN a user registers THEN their password SHALL be hashed using the configured algorithm before storage
4. WHEN a user authenticates THEN the system SHALL verify the password against the stored hash using the appropriate algorithm

### Requirement 4: Core Authentication Operations

**User Story:** As an application user, I want to register, login, and manage my profile securely, so that I can access protected resources in the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user registers THEN the system SHALL create a user account with encrypted sensitive data
2. WHEN a user logs in with valid credentials THEN the system SHALL issue authentication tokens
3. WHEN a user updates their profile THEN the system SHALL validate and store the changes securely
4. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate their active session tokens

### Requirement 5: Multi-Factor Authentication

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want to enable multi-factor authentication using various methods, so that my account has additional protection beyond passwords.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MFA is enabled THEN the system SHALL support TOTP-based authentication
2. WHEN SMS MFA is configured THEN the system SHALL send verification codes via SMS
3. WHEN email MFA is enabled THEN the system SHALL send verification codes via email
4. WHEN hardware keys are used THEN the system SHALL support WebAuthn/FIDO2 protocols

### Requirement 6: Social Authentication Integration

**User Story:** As an application user, I want to authenticate using my existing social media accounts, so that I don't need to create and remember additional credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OAuth is configured for Google THEN users SHALL be able to authenticate using Google accounts
2. WHEN OAuth is configured for Facebook THEN users SHALL be able to authenticate using Facebook accounts
3. WHEN OAuth is configured for GitHub THEN users SHALL be able to authenticate using GitHub accounts
4. WHEN social authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL create or link user accounts appropriately

### Requirement 7: Enterprise SSO Support

**User Story:** As an enterprise administrator, I want to integrate with existing identity providers using SAML 2.0 and OpenID Connect, so that employees can use their corporate credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SAML 2.0 is configured THEN the system SHALL act as a Service Provider for SAML authentication
2. WHEN OpenID Connect is configured THEN the system SHALL support OIDC authentication flows
3. WHEN LDAP/Active Directory integration is enabled THEN the system SHALL authenticate against directory services
4. WHEN enterprise SSO is used THEN user attributes SHALL be synchronized from the identity provider

### Requirement 8: Role-Based Access Control

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to define roles and permissions for users, so that I can control access to different parts of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN roles are defined THEN the system SHALL store role definitions with associated permissions
2. WHEN users are assigned roles THEN they SHALL inherit the permissions of those roles
3. WHEN access is requested THEN the system SHALL validate permissions before granting access
4. WHEN permissions change THEN the changes SHALL take effect for subsequent requests

### Requirement 9: Database Integration with SQLC

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use SQLC for database operations, so that I have type-safe, efficient SQL queries with compile-time validation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database queries are needed THEN they SHALL be defined in SQL files and compiled with SQLC
2. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL connect to PostgreSQL as the primary database
3. WHEN caching is needed THEN the system SHALL use Redis for session storage and frequently accessed data
4. WHEN database migrations are required THEN they SHALL be versioned and applied automatically

### Requirement 10: Security and Threat Protection

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want comprehensive security features including rate limiting and threat detection, so that the system is protected against common attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requests exceed rate limits THEN the system SHALL implement sliding window rate limiting
2. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL implement account lockout policies
3. WHEN data is stored THEN sensitive information SHALL be encrypted using AES-256
4. WHEN data is transmitted THEN it SHALL be protected using TLS 1.3

### Requirement 11: Admin Dashboard

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a comprehensive admin dashboard, so that I can manage users, monitor system health, and configure settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the admin dashboard THEN administrators SHALL be able to view user management interfaces
2. WHEN monitoring is needed THEN the dashboard SHALL display system metrics and health status
3. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN they SHALL be applied without requiring system restart
4. WHEN alerts are triggered THEN administrators SHALL be notified through the dashboard

### Requirement 12: Scalability and Deployment Flexibility

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the system to support both monolithic and microservice deployments, so that it can be adapted to different architectural requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployed as a monolith THEN all services SHALL run in a single process
2. WHEN deployed as microservices THEN services SHALL be independently scalable
3. WHEN horizontal scaling is needed THEN the system SHALL support stateless operation
4. WHEN deployed in Kubernetes THEN it SHALL include appropriate manifests and health checks

### Requirement 13: Monitoring and Observability

**User Story:** As a site reliability engineer, I want comprehensive monitoring and observability features, so that I can maintain system health and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system events occur THEN they SHALL be logged with appropriate detail levels
2. WHEN metrics are collected THEN they SHALL be compatible with Prometheus
3. WHEN health checks are performed THEN they SHALL report accurate system status
4. WHEN audit trails are needed THEN all authentication events SHALL be logged immutably
